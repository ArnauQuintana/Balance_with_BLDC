# Balance with BLDC 
This project was developed in 2022 in a lecture from my BSc. The objective was to design a balance which, with 2 BLDC motors, could find the desired angle. 

The next image shows the block diagram of the system:

It was composed by 2 BLDC controllers controlled by a MSP430 programmed in bare metal and a central controller programmed with TI-RTOS.
